## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

-- python is called aa a general purpose language because we can do amny things in python like creating some model to predict the future instance or like automating some tasks or simply doing mathematical operations.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

--Python is called a dynamic typed language because we are not required to intialize any variable type way before cmpilation. Python is smart enough to create a variable and give a type to it dynamically.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

-- pros:
   a. it is dynamic langage
   b. it is open source
   c. it has many bunch of libraries
   d. easy to learn
   
   cons:
   a. since it is dynamic it is slow
   b. it consumes lot of memory
   c. gives runtime errors than compilation
   

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

-- Python can be used in various domains like web development,AI,Machine learning and so on.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

-- Variables are kind  of containers where we store the value which is to be assigned. We can decaler a variable as follows
<variable_name> = <value>  eg. n = 5

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

-- we can take input from the user usng input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

-- string

Q8. What is type casting?

-- Type casting is basically coneverting a data from one type to another. Eg conerting a integer value to float and vise versa

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

-- Yes we can take multiple inputs from a user. We can use loop on the input() function and take multiple values.

Q10. What are keywords?

-- Keywords are reserved words in python.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

-- No we cant use them because they are reserved for some purpoe they have special meaning in the language.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

-- Indentation is very important in python. It defines which line of code belongs to which block and so on.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

-- we can use print() function t output anything on screen.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

-- Operators are of various types like Arithetic operators, comparison operators and so on

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

-- / means float division whereas // means integer divison

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

-- print("iNeuron"*4)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

-- n = input("Enter a numeber: ")
   if n%2==0:
      print("Number is even")
   else:
      print("Number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

-- boolean operators are of 2 types ie True and False.

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
1 or 0

-- True

0 and 0

-- False

True and False and True

-- False

1 or 0 or 0

-- True

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

-- Whenever we have to applysome condition and if that condition satsfies than we have to excute a block of code than we use condtional statements.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

-- this is the conditional statement. in If the main or base case is checked if it fails than the cursor or the pointer moves to elif part if that passes than the statements inside the blocks are excuted and if it that block as well fails than the pointer will go to else block.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

-- loops are like cycles which runs multiple times until the condition satisfies.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

-- There 3 types of loops. while,for and do-while

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

-- we use for loop whenever we are aware of the no of iterations whereas while is mainly used i cases where we are not sure about iteration rather a condition

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

-- continue is used to skip the statements following it and to start the new iteration of the loop.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

-- break statement exits a loop.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

-- whenever we do not have any statement in the function or loop we try to pass it so that the programs doesnt give the compilation error.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

-- range()  function basically gives the range of numbers based on the parameters passed in it.

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?

-- we can use items() method or keys() method and get the values from the dictionary.
